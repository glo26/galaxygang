# Galaxy Gang
Galaxy Gang is a play-to-earn game sitting on Polygon chain.
Other tech stacks include: Moralis, IPFS protocol, and Construct 3.

Based on the past play-to-earn games that have failed their communities and the current industry landscape, we decided to act on a 'Genesis' whitepaper we wrote in 2021, made revisions based on our past experiences and R&D in the P2E industry, and coded a 2022 version during Moralis Hackathon. We believe that this game is playable even on the lowest-grade of Android phones in developing countries, all around the world: making it accessible to everyone.

Galaxy Gang was made to prioritize serving the undeserved and economically marginalized communities in the gaming world as it is made with "low-data" mode in mind. We have also revised the tokenomics after a careful study on other games such Axie Infinity, Cryptomines, and many other well-known P2E players. 

Through such R&D, we have designed our game to possess economic sustainability. Such endeavor is achievable through the adoption of lootboxes and spaceship credit on top of installing security to prevent the possibility of using script-based bots that could 'accidentally' drain all the reward pool.

Last but not least, all earnings were designed to be limited to players consistently scoring in the top ranks of the leaderboard. Within the highest scores in the top 5% of players on the leaderboard. To incenticize user growth and stimulate community loyalty, we will also hold monthly raffles and giveaways.

To close, our goal is to bring economic opportunities to the underserved communities by eliminating the cost of entry per spaceship NFT, providing sponsored spaceship scholarship seats, and doubling down on the skill-based leaderboard above incentivizing users who put in efforts to play consistently on a daily basis. Galaxy Gang was also made to first target players who are accustomed to mobile gaming already with little to no knowledge of the web3 world by providing a free-to-play version as it is a mobile-friendly casual 'space shooter' game that comes with its own twists, flair, heroic storyline, and characters. With the embedded storyline, we hope to create a continued interest and spike a community of figurines + merch collectors.

This way, we will be able to bring more people into web3 and accelerate the adoption of such innovation. For more info on our project or if you would like to contribute to it, please contact Gloria Felicia [ GLO ] at gloria@virginia.edu. Thank you!

# Galaxy Gang Game

Galaxy Gang Game was created using Construct 3 Game Engine. This was our choice of "low data" mode to accommodate for ease of accessibility in even the most remote areas of the globe - we want to stay mindful of all our communities all around the world.

Per our Roadmap, we plan to migrate to Unreal Engine and enter the metaverse with our collaboration with Metaphy.
