# Galaxy Gang
Galaxy Gang is a play-to-earn game sitting on Polygon chain. Other tech stacks include: Moralis, IPFS protocol, and Construct 3.

Based on the past play-to-earn games that have failed their communities and the current industry landscape, we decided to act on a whitepaper we wrote in 2021 and coded a 2022 version that we think will work. We believe that this game is playable even on the lowest-grade Android phones in developing countries all around the world--making it accessible to everyone.

Galaxy Gang is made to serve the undeserved and economically marginalized communities as it is made with "low-data" mode in mind. We have also revised the tokenomics after a careful study on other games such Axie Infinity, Cryptomines, and many other well-known P2E players. Through such R&D, we have designed our game to possess tokenomic sustainability. This is achievable thorugh the adoption of lootboxes and spaceship credit on top of installing security to prevent the possibility of using script-based bots. Last but not least, all earnings are limited to players consistently scoring in the top ranks of the leaderboard. Within the highest scores in the top 5% of players on the leaderboard, we will also hold monthly raffles to incenticize user growth and stimulate community loyalty. 

Our goal is to bring economic opportunities to the underserved communities by eliminating the cost of entry per spaceship NFT, providing sponsored spaceship scholarship seats, and doubling down on skill-based leaderboard that features people who play on a consistent basis (daily check-ins + strikes). We will target players who are accustomed to mobile gaming already with little to no knowledge of the web3 world by providing a free-to-play version.

This way, we will be able to bring more people into web3 and accelerate the adoption of such innovation. For more info on our project or if you would like to contribute to it, please contact Gloria Felicia [ GLO ] at gloria@virginia.edu. Thank you!
